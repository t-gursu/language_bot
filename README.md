The bot leverages Groq Cloud for language processing and is powered by a Node.js backend.

Dynamic Conversations: Engages users with creative questions to sustain an interesting and educational conversation.

Motivational Feedback: Encourages users to keep improving their language skills.


## Prerequisites:
Node.js (v14 or higher)

Telegram Bot Token (can be created via BotFather)

Groq Cloud account for language processing.Installation

## Start the bot
/start: This will initiate the bot and ask the user to choose a language (English or German) for practice.

/change: This command allows users to switch between English and German practice sessions.

## Example Interaction (English session):
User: "I go to the park yesterday."
Bot Feedback: "Good try! Instead of 'go,' you should use 'went' because it's past tense. So, 'I went to the park yesterday' is correct."

Bot Response: "What did you do at the park? Did you have fun?"

## Example Interaction (German session):
User: "Ich bin am Wochenende nach Berlin gefahren."
Bot Feedback: "Sehr gut! Die Satzstruktur ist korrekt, aber statt 'am Wochenende' k√∂nntest du auch 'letztes Wochenende' sagen, um klarer zu machen, dass es das vergangene Wochenende war."

Bot Response:
"Was hast du in Berlin gemacht? Hast du interessante Orte besucht?"
"What did you do in Berlin? Did you visit any interesting places?"
